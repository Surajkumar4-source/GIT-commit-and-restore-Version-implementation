Git Workflow for Merging Branches (with Explanations)

Step-by-Step Breakdown of Your Git Workflow

Initialize the Repository:
1. You first created a local Git repository using `git init`:
    ```
    git init
    ```
   - This initializes a new Git repository in your project directory. It allows Git to start tracking your changes.

Create and Edit Files:
2. You created and edited the `index.html` file, and then committed the changes:
    ```
    nano index.html
    git add .
    git commit -m "first commit"
    ```
   - `nano index.html`: You created and edited the `index.html` file.
   - `git add .`: Stages all changes (including new and modified files).
   - `git commit -m "first commit"`: Commits the staged changes with a message.

Create a New Branch (hello):
3. You created a new branch called `hello` but later deleted it:
    ```
    git branch hello
    git branch -d hello
    ```
   - `git branch hello`: Creates a new branch called `hello`.
   - `git branch -d hello`: Deletes the `hello` branch (likely because you no longer needed it).

Switch to main Branch and Initialize Remote Repository:
4. You then switched to the main branch and initialized a remote repository:
    ```
    git remote add origin https://github.com/codeshare-ByRakesh/demo.git
    ```
   - `git remote add origin`: Links your local repository to a remote repository (on GitHub).
   - This prepares your local repository to push changes to GitHub.

Create and Commit Files in main Branch:
5. You created a file `master.txt`, committed it, and pushed it to the remote repository:
    ```
    touch master.txt
    git add .
    git commit -m "first commit"
    git push origin main
    ```
   - `git push origin main`: Pushes your local commits to the remote `main` branch.

Create a New Branch (suraj):
6. You created a new branch `suraj` and worked on it:
    ```
    git branch suraj
    git checkout suraj
    ```
   - `git branch suraj`: Creates the `suraj` branch.
   - `git checkout suraj`: Switches to the `suraj` branch to work on it.

Edit and Commit Changes on suraj:
7. On the `suraj` branch, you created and added a new file `filefromsuraj_branch.txt` and committed the changes:
    ```
    nano filefromsuraj_branch.txt
    git add .
    git commit -m "2nd commit"
    git push origin suraj
    ```
   - `nano filefromsuraj_branch.txt`: Created a new file in the `suraj` branch.
   - `git add .`: Staged the new file.
   - `git commit -m "2nd commit"`: Committed the changes in `suraj` branch.
   - `git push origin suraj`: Pushed the `suraj` branch to the remote repository.

Switch Back to main and Pull Latest Changes:
8. You switched back to the main branch and pulled the latest changes from the remote repository:
    ```
    git checkout main
    git pull origin main
    ```
   - `git checkout main`: Switches back to the main branch to prepare for merging.
   - `git pull origin main`: Pulls the latest changes from the remote main branch.

Merge suraj into main:
9. You merged the `suraj` branch into `main`:
    ```
    git merge suraj
    ```
   - `git merge suraj`: Merges the changes from `suraj` branch into `main`. If there are conflicts, Git will alert you to resolve them manually.

Commit and Push the Merged Changes:
10. After merging, you committed the changes and pushed them to the remote repository:
    ```
    git add .
    git commit -m "Merged suraj branch into main"
    git push origin main
    ```
   - `git add .`: Stages any changes after the merge.
   - `git commit -m "Merged suraj branch into main"`: Commits the merge.
   - `git push origin main`: Pushes the merged changes back to the remote `main` branch.

Handle Potential Push Rejection (due to Diverging Histories):
11. If the push is rejected because the remote repository has new commits, pull the latest changes:
    ```
    git pull origin main
    git push origin main
    ```
   - `git pull origin main`: Pulls any new changes from the remote `main` to make sure your local branch is up to date.
   - `git push origin main`: After resolving any conflicts, pushes the changes again.

Git Workflow Summary:
- Initialize Local Repository:
    ```
    git init
    git add .
    git commit -m "first commit"
    ```
- Link Remote Repository:
    ```
    git remote add origin <URL>
    git push origin main
    ```
- Create Feature Branch (suraj):
    ```
    git branch suraj
    git checkout suraj
    git commit -m "2nd commit"
    git push origin suraj
    ```
- Merge Branch into main:
    ```
    git checkout main
    git pull origin main
    git merge suraj
    git push origin main
    ```
